	<h3>Junior Email and Texting Parent Consent Form</h3>
	<p>In accordance with official Archery GB guidelines, any junior members of the club who wish to be contacted directly by the club via email or text message must have permission from their parents or guardians, via this form. An opt-out from such communications is also available. Further information can be found on the cover page of the form, which is downloadable <a href="static/docs/text-and-email-messaging-juniors-parent-consent-form.pdf">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Club Scores Database</h3>
	<p>During April 2012, our Records Officer Carl Myers launched a new <a href="http://www.fistmele.com/cgi-bin/results.cgi">online scores database</a>, to allow members to keep track of the scores they have submitted. Scores must still be submitted in the usual way i.e. by leaving them in the filing point on the clubhouse wall. In the near future, the website will also provide information on member's handicaps and classification.</p>
