	<h3>The Committee</h3>
	<p>The club committee is a group of elected members, who work together to organise the club's day-to-day operations. The committee meets regularly, and their meetings will be advertised via this website. Similarly, the minutes of past committee meetings will appear on this page.</p>
	<p>Committee members are elected annually at the club AGM. Further information on the role and function of the committee can be found in the <a href="static/docs/Andover-Archers-Constitution-Nov-2011.pdf">club's constitution</a>.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
	<h3>Executive Members</h3>
	<p>The "executive" committee positions are the Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer. At least two executive members of the committee must be present at a committee meeting, out of an overall quorum of four.</p>

	<p>Bowstyle: Longbow</p>
	<p>Bio: Returned to archery after a 20 year break in 2005 as it was a sport in which all of my family could take part. Joined Andover Archers in 2010 because of the fantastic facilities and the opportunity to shoot 24/7. I shoot Longbow just for fun but my two daughters aged 12 and 16 are now both Junior Master Bowmen!</p>

	<p>Name: Ed Rial</p>
	<p>Bowstyle: Recurve</p>
	<p>Bio: Bio: I first started archery when I was 9 years old, although unfortunately my local club in Yorkshire folded two years later. Luckily I attended the University of Birmingham which had a very experienced club and was able to pick the sport up again. I also became heavily involved in running the student club and various student tournaments. Since leaving university I have surfaced in various clubs around the country but have found Andover Archers to be welcoming with excellent facilities.</p> 
	<p>I don’t seem to be able to stop myself getting involved in an organisational role and currently hold the role of Treasurer – and subsequently the pursestrings – of the club.</p>

	<p>Bowstyle: Recurve</p>
	<p>Bio: Been shooting since 1985, reached MB status and represented the County on numerous occasions. I now shoot for the camaraderie; those serious days are long gone!</p>
	<p>I am a County Coach, an aspect of Archery that I love doing. I have taught a couple who were visually impaired (a challenge for them and for me), people with learning disabilities and children as young as five, a good test of patience, have you ever tried keeping a five year olds attention for more than 2 arrows?</p>
	<p>I can honestly say I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute.</p>

	<h3>Co-opted Club Members</h3>
	<p>The committee may from time to time decide to co-opt members of the club into a formal role, additional to the normal committee positions. Their position is officially ended at each AGM, although they can be co-opted again at the same meeting with the agreement of the membership.</p> 

	<p>The co-opted members are not formally part of the committee, and cannot vote at committee meetings. However, they are listed here for completeness and to recognise their contribution to the club.</p>
