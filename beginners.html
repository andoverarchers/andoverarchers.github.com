<p class="mt">Andover Archers has a large selection of club equipment and all of the necessary equipment will be provided.</p> 

<p class="mt">All archers completing the course to a suitable standard will be issued with a GNAS recognised certificate of competency, which will enable the holder to apply for membership of any archery club.</p>
