	<h3>24th April 2012 - New online database of club scores.</h3>
	<p>A message from Carl, our club records officer:</p>
	<p><i>Hello All,</p>
	<p>We're introducing a new system where all the scores submitted to the Records Officer (that's me!) will be recorded on a database that you can access on the internet.  You'll be able to view all the scores as I enter them, and we'll always have a back up of all the scores if there are any problems.</p>
	<p>You can access all the scores <a href="http://www.fistmele.com/cgi-bin/results.cgi">here.</a>
	<p>The scores that are entered at the moment are those I've received from the club, and I intend to enter the results from shoots that people have attended as I get more time.  If you leave results in the pigeonhole in the club house, I'll enter them for you.  In time I will get the club records on here too, and enter your scores from previous years.</p>
	<p>One quick request - please make sure you record scores, names and dates correctly and clearly on your score sheets, and do yell at me if I make any mistakes entering them - they're easily fixed!</p>
	<p>After a bit more work this page will also tell you your GNAS handicap and classification - I'll let you know when that's added.</p>
	<p>Cheers, Carl.</i></p>

	<h3>7th February 2012 - Just a couple of points</h3>
	<p>1)  Due to a clash with the RNSCA shoot at HMS COLLINGWOOD, the coaching session for February has been cancelled.</p>

  	<p>Coaching sessions will resume in March and currently we have penciled the date of Saturday 17th (to be confirmed).</p>
 
	<p>2)  The club heating</p>
      	<p>At the moment the heating has been programmed to operate at the following times.</p>
 
        <p>Monday - Saturday.  On between 09:30 and 11:00. On again between 16:50 and 22:00</p>
        <p>Sunday.  On between  09:30 and 12:00   on again between 16:50 and 22:00.</p>
 
         <p>These times are at the moment under discussion and I suspect will change.</p>
         <p>There is a possibility of one unit being left on between the sessions to keep the club at a better temperature.</p>
 
	<p>3)   The February frostbite will be shot this Sunday 12th commencing at 10:00.</p>

	<h3>13th February 2012 - HAMPSHIRE TEAM SELECTION TRIALS</h3>

	<p>It has just been announced that the Hampshire Team Selection Trials for 2012 will be held on Sunday 1st April at HMS Collingwood, Fareham.</p>

	<p>Full details of times and eligibility to enter the Trials will be issued soon and entry forms will be put onto the Club notice board.</p>

	<p>Past criteria was for Adults to have a Bowmen Classification but for Juniors there was no restriction. This may be relaxed this year.</p>

	<p>Given the success of both Senior and Junior archers from Andover over the past 12 months, it would be nice to see a big turn out for the Trials.</p>

	<p>Last year, we had three Juniors who actually represented Hampshire in the match against Sussex.</p>

	<p>It is an honour to represent your County and is a tremendous boost to the prestige of Andover Archers to have Club Members in the County Team!</p>

	<p>Please put this date in your diary and start training now!</p>

	<p>-Terry</p>

	<p>12 juniors from Andover were entered for the 2012 Talisman competition on Sunday 5th February. Sadly, the overnight bad weather forced 4 of them to withdraw on the morning of the shoot. The remaining 8 young archers produced one of the finest performances by Andover Archers for many years.</p>

	<p><name>Harry Welfare</name> took Gold in the Under 18 Gents Recurve.</p>

	<p><name>Abbie Loader</name> took Gold in the Under 18 Ladies Recurve.</p>

	<p><name>William Talmage</name> took Gold in the Under 16 Gents Compound.</p>
	
	<p><name>Adam Portsmouth</name> took Gold in the Under 14 Gents Recurve.</p>

	<p><name>Jonathan Smith</name> took Silver in the Under 14 Gents Recurve.</p>

	<p><name>Vicky Loader</name> took Gold in the Under 14 Ladies Recurve.</p>

	<p><name>Jamie Welfare</name> took Gold in the junior Gents Longbow.</p>

	<p><name>Michael Russell</name> took Gold in the Under 12 Gents Recurve.</p>

	<p>If all that was not enough, <name>Harry</name>, <name>Abbie</name> and <name>Adam</name> also won Silver medals in the recurve team event, and <name>Harry</name> added another Gold for the "Best Gold".</p>
