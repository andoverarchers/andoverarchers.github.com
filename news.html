		<h3>7th August 2012 - Members of Andover Archers part of overall Hampshire team triumph at Salisbury Double FITA 70.</h3>
		<p>On Sunday 5th August 2012, as part of the Salisbury Double FITA 70 shoot, an inter-county match was held between Dorset & Wiltshire and Hampshire.</p>

		<p>Three archers from Andover were selected to be part of the Hampshire Team. Paul Talmage was again selected for the Gents Recurve while Abbie Loader who had made two previous appearances for the Hampshire Junior team was selected to make her first appearance for the Senior Team. Steph Watson made her first ever appearance for the County when selected for the Ladies Compound.</p>

		<p>In the absence of Gill Millward, Nick Loader took over as Team Manager for the day.</p>

		<p>It was a really close match overall with DWAA winning the Gents Recurve and Ladies Compound but Hampshire fighting back to win the Gents Compound and Ladies Recurve.</p>

		<p>Overall, Hampshire triumphed by just 33 points with the total scores 13647 for DWAA against 13680 for Hampshire and it was a proud moment for Nick when he received the Trophy on behalf of the Team.</p>

		<p>There was more good news for Andover in the results of the shoot itself with Abbie winning the Under 20s Junior award, beating her own County Record by no less than 103 points in the morning session. Not to be outdone, Vicky Loader won the under 17s Cadet award in her first ever attemp at 60m!</p>

		<h3>27th May 2012 - Andover Archers compete and win at Southampton H2H.</h3>

		<p>Andover was represented by Paul Talmage in the Gent's Recurve, Steve Wrigley in the Gent's Compound and Steph Watson in the ladies Compound but the highlight for the Club was the performance of Sally Allan and Abbie Loader in the Ladies Recurve!</p>

In the afternoon H2H knockout section, both archers reached the Semi Final stage where they were drawn against each other with Sally being victorious. Sally went on to win the event while Abbie won the shoot out to finish 3rd! Abigail also set a new Hampshire County Record for the 70m section.</p>
		<p>On Sunday, after the morning qualifying round, Sally was seeded 2 and Abbie was again seeded 7. This time, they faced each other in the Quarter Final with Sally again being victorious. Like Saturday, Sally again went on to win the tournament beating the number 1 seed in the Final.</p>

		<h3>24th April 2012 - New online database of club scores.</h3>
		<p>A message from Carl, our club records officer:</p>
		<p><i>Hello All,</p>
		<p>We're introducing a new system where all the scores submitted to the Records Officer (that's me!) will be recorded on a database that you can access on the internet.  You'll be able to view all the scores as I enter them, and we'll always have a back up of all the scores if there are any problems.</p>
		<p>You can access all the scores <a href="http://www.fistmele.com/cgi-bin/results.cgi">here.</a>
		<p>The scores that are entered at the moment are those I've received from the club, and I intend to enter the results from shoots that people have attended as I get more time.  If you leave results in the pigeonhole in the club house, I'll enter them for you.  In time I will get the club records on here too, and enter your scores from previous years.</p>
		<p>One quick request - please make sure you record scores, names and dates correctly and clearly on your score sheets, and do yell at me if I make any mistakes entering them - they're easily fixed!</p>
		<p>After a bit more work this page will also tell you your GNAS handicap and classification - I'll let you know when that's added.</p>
		<p>Cheers, Carl.</i></p>

		<h3>7th February 2012 - Just a couple of points</h3>
		<p>1)  Due to a clash with the RNSCA shoot at HMS COLLINGWOOD, the coaching session for February has been cancelled.</p>
		<p>Coaching sessions will resume in March and currently we have penciled the date of Saturday 17th (to be confirmed).</p>
 		<p>2)  The club heating</p>
      		<p>At the moment the heating has been programmed to operate at the following times.</p>
         	<p>Monday - Saturday.  On between 09:30 and 11:00. On again between 16:50 and 22:00</p>
        	<p>Sunday.  On between  09:30 and 12:00   on again between 16:50 and 22:00.</p>
	        <p>These times are at the moment under discussion and I suspect will change.</p>
         	<p>There is a possibility of one unit being left on between the sessions to keep the club at a better temperature.</p>
		<p>3)   The February frostbite will be shot this Sunday 12th commencing at 10:00.</p>

		<h3>13th February 2012 - HAMPSHIRE TEAM SELECTION TRIALS</h3>
		<p>It has just been announced that the Hampshire Team Selection Trials for 2012 will be held on Sunday 1st April at HMS Collingwood, Fareham.</p>
		<p>Full details of times and eligibility to enter the Trials will be issued soon and entry forms will be put onto the Club notice board.</p>
		<p>Past criteria was for Adults to have a Bowmen Classification but for Juniors there was no restriction. This may be relaxed this year.</p>
		<p>Given the success of both Senior and Junior archers from Andover over the past 12 months, it would be nice to see a big turn out for the Trials.</p>
		<p>Last year, we had three Juniors who actually represented Hampshire in the match against Sussex.</p>
		<p>It is an honour to represent your County and is a tremendous boost to the prestige of Andover Archers to have Club Members in the County Team!</p>
		<p>Please put this date in your diary and start training now!</p>
		<p>-Terry</p>
